# Description

This website presents an example of a Canonical Correlation Analysis of a wine data-set.

The example was coded in R. To help the reader understand the commands we used, we will use chunks of R code similar to this one:

```r
set.seed(314)
x <- rnorm(15)
mean(x)
[1] -0.4882177
```

The reproducible code used to generate the figures, along with the data set, are available on the GitHub page.
