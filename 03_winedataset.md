To illustrate CCA we use the  data set 
presented in Table \ref{tab:Wines4CCA}.
These data describe thirty-six 
red, ros√©, or white wines
produced in three different countries
(Chili, Canada, and USA) using several different varietal of grapes.
These wines are described by two different sets of variables.
The first set of variables (i.e., matrix X) 
describes the objective properties of the wines:
Price, Acidity, Alcohol content, Sugar, and Tannin
(in what follows we capitalize these descriptors).
The second set of variables (i.e., matrix Y) 
describes the subjective properties of the wines as evaluated
by a professional wine taster and consists in ratings
on a 9-point rating scale of 8 aspects of taste:
fruity, floral, vegetal, spicy, woody, sweet, astringent, acidic,     
plus an overall evaluation of the hedonic aspect of the wine 
(i.e., how much the taster liked the wine).
