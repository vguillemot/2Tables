# Latent variables

The \cca 
of these data
found $5$ pairs of latent variables (in general \cca will find a maximum 
of
$\min(I,J)$ pairs of latent variables). 
The values of the canonical correlations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Rsv}.
The first and second canonical correlations are very high ($.98$ and $.85$),
and so we will only consider them here.
As shown in Figures \ref{fig:cca1} and \ref{fig:cca2},
the latent variables extracted by the analysis are very sensitive to 
the ``the color'' of the wines: 
The first pair of latent variables
(Figure \ref{fig:cca1}) isolates the red wines, 
whereas the second
pair of latent variables (Figure \ref{fig:cca1}) 
roughly orders the wines according to their concentration of red pigment (i.e., 
white, ros√©, and red; similar plots using grape varietal or origin of the wines did not show any interesting patterns and are therefore not shown)
